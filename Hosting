We should  be aware of the hoisting feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they’re defined.

console.log(greetWorld()); // Output: Hello, World!

function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
Notice how hoisting allowed greetWorld() to be called before the greetWorld() function was defined! Since hoisting isn’t considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.

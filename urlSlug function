Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

The output should be all lower-cased letters

The output should not have any spaces




  Answer
  
  let str= "   ";

//console.log(str.split(" "));

//split an empty string mean there is a word with 0 charcter, but i want a word which have at least 1 
function urlSlug(newStr){
  
  
  return  newStr.split(" ").filter(word => word.length > 0).map(word => word.toLowerCase()).join("-");
}

console.log(urlSlug("Winter Is Coming"));
